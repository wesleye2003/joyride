# Joyride

Joyride is a Sinatra web application that consumes the [Life Expectancy API](https://market.mashape.com/bechllc/life-expectancy "Life Expectancy") to take a user's gender and age and cross reference that with average life expectancy data to represent the user's remaining lifespan in several humorous and random formats, like 'number of donuts you can eat before you die,' or 'number of roller coaster rides you can take.'
